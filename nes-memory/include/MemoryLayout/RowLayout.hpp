 * @brief Implements a row layout, that maps all tuples in a tuple buffer to a row-wise layout.
 * For a schema with 3 fields (F1, F2, and F3) we retrieve the following layout.
 *
 * | F1, F2, F3 |
 * | F1, F2, F3 |
 * | F1, F2, F3 |
 *
 * This may be beneficial for processing performance if all fields of the tuple are accessed.
