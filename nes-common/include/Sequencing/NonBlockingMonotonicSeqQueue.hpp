/// which is mainly used as a foundation for an efficient watermark processor.
/// This queue receives values of type T with an associated sequence number and
/// returns the value with the highest sequence number in strictly monotonic increasing order.
///
/// Internally this queue is implemented as a linked-list of blocks and each block stores a array of <seq,T> pairs.
/// |------- |       |------- |
/// | s1, s2 | ----> | s3, s4 |
/// |------- |       | ------ |
///
/// The high level flow is the following:
/// If we receive the following sequence of input pairs <seq,T>:
/// Note that the events with seq 3 and 5 are received out-of-order.
///
/// [<1,T1>,<2,T2>,<4,T4>,<6,T6>,<3,T3>,<7,T7>,<5,T5>]
///
/// GetCurrentValue will return the following sequence of current values:
/// [<1,T1>,<2,T2>,<2,T2>,<2,T2>,<2,T2>,<4,T6>,<7,T7>]
